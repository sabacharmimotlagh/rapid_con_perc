Run each of these codes for the desired plot!

Plot1: plot grand total results and MDS \n
Plot2: plot decoding curve and temporal generalization matrix for general visible vs. invisible condition \n
Plot3: plot decoding curve and temporal generalization matrix for visible and invisible conditions using single target images \n
Plot4: plot decoding curve and temporal generalization matrix for general visible vs. invisible condition for face/object category \n
Plot5: 

Run Bootstrap_VisibleInvisible, which uses bootstrap_visible_invisible function, to find the decoding/temporal generalization matrix for Visible condition vs. Invisible condition (so you have 2 classes overall)!

Run Bootstrap_SingleTarget, which uses boorstrap_single_target function, to find the decoding/temporal generalization matrix for Visible and invisible condition of each target image (so you around 80 classes overall)!
